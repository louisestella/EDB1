Recursion Exercises
===================


### Description

Exercises to implement recursive and tail recursive functions using C++.


### Compilation

1. Access the main directory of the Recursive Exercises using this command: `cd ~/02-Recursao`.
<<<<<<< HEAD
2. Now type `g++ [q3].cpp -o [q3] -Wall -pedantic -std=c++11` on the terminal and press ENTER.
3. The project has been compiled.
4. Remember to replace `[q3]` with the question that you wish to test.
=======
2. Now type `g++ q3.cpp -o q3 -Wall -pedantic -std=c++11` on the terminal and press ENTER.
3. The project has been compiled.
4. Remember to replace `q3` with the question that you wish to test.

5. Repeat this for every question you want to verify.


### Execution

1. If you are still in the main directory of the Recursive Exercises, skip to the next step. Otherwise, access it.
<<<<<<< HEAD
2. Now type `./[q3]` and press ENTER.
3. Remember to replace `[q3]` with the question that you wish to test.
=======
2. Now type `./q3` and press ENTER.

4. There you go! The program should be up and running.


### Content of the questions

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. Function that revert a string recursively;
2. Converts a decimal number to a binary one;
3. Tail recursive function that sums the digits of a number;
4. Tail recursive function that returns the N-th Fibonacci term of the Fibonacci Sequence;
5. Returns the min element of an array of integers;
6. Returns the sum of all elements of an array of integers;
7. Given and KEY, this function returns the index of an array that matches the KEY.
